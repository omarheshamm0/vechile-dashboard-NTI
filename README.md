## 2. Description

### In one sentence

**You are building the instrument cluster of a car — the speedometer, the rev
counter, the fuel gauge and the warning lamps.**

### What the circuit looks like

| Input | Stands for | How it arrives |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Pulse source 1 | Wheel-speed sensor | A stream of pulses on `ICP1` |
| Pulse source 2 | Ignition pulses | A stream of pulses on `INT0` |
| Potentiometer 1 | Fuel level | Analog |
| Potentiometer 2 | Coolant temperature | Analog |
| Potentiometer 3 | Battery voltage | Analog |
| Potentiometer 4 | Oil pressure | Analog |

Outputs: an LCD for the numbers, a row of warning lamps driven through a shift
register, and a 74HC165 that reads the body switches back **in** over the same
bus.

### The first thing you have to get right: two pulse inputs, two opposite methods

Both road speed and engine RPM arrive as pulses. You might expect to measure
them the same way. **You must not**, and explaining why is a graded question in
the defence.

**Road speed — measure the *gap between* pulses (the period).**

A car crawling in traffic produces very few pulses per second. If you counted
them over a 250 ms window you might get 1 pulse, or 0, or 2 — your speedometer
would jump between 0, 7 and 14 km/h with nothing in between. Useless.

But the *gap* between two pulses at that speed is long — tens of milliseconds —
and a 16-bit timer can measure it very precisely. So: capture the timer value at
each pulse, subtract, and you have an accurate speed even at walking pace.

**Engine RPM — *count* pulses in a fixed window.**

An idling engine already produces hundreds of pulses per second, and RPM changes
slowly. Counting for 250 ms gives you a big number with plenty of resolution,
and it costs almost nothing. Measuring individual gaps here would be needless
work, and every little variation between cylinders would make the needle jitter.

> **The rule to remember:** *slow signal → measure the period. Fast signal →
> count the pulses.* This comes up in every embedded job you will ever have.

### The second thing: two chips sharing one SPI bus

Two shift registers hang off the **same** three SPI wires, and they work in
opposite directions:

| Chip | Direction | Wire it uses | Strobe |
|------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| 74HC595 | **out** — drives the 8 warning lamps | `MOSI` | `RCLK` latches |
| 74HC165 | **in** — reads the 6 body switches | `MISO` | `SH/LD` samples |

The rule is absolute: **only one chip may be driving the bus at a time.** If the
165 is clocked while the 595 is being latched, the lamps show a pattern built
from half-shifted data, and the switch byte you read back is garbage — with no
error message anywhere.

The dangerous version of this bug is the *interrupted* one: a lamp refresh
starts, a button scan fires in the middle and clocks the bus, and both
transfers are silently wrong. Every transaction is therefore wrapped in an
acquire / release pair, and neither may interrupt the other.

### The third thing: reading a 32-bit counter that an ISR is writing

The odometer must never lose more than **100 m**, ever, including during a power
cut in the middle of a write.

That number is a 32-bit count of metres, and it is written by one context and
read by another. On an 8-bit CPU that is four separate byte reads — and the
odometer task can update the value **in between two of them**. You would read
the low half of the new value and the high half of the old one, and display a
distance the car has never travelled.

The fix is an **atomic read**: disable interrupts for the four bytes, copy, then
restore. It is three lines, and leaving it out produces a bug that appears once
every few thousand updates and is nearly impossible to reproduce on demand.

> **On persistence.** A real cluster keeps the odometer through a power cut, and
> that is a genuinely interesting problem — write throttling, wear levelling and
> atomic slot updates. None of it can be built here, because SimulIDE has no
> non-volatile part. The odometer therefore starts at zero on every power-up.
> Describe in your report what a real implementation would have to add.

### The rest of it

- The **LCD** shows speed, RPM and the four analog readings.
- The **lamp cluster** lights warnings with the correct priority.
- The **serial link** streams the whole dashboard and accepts commands.

## 3. Objectives

1. Measure a pulse period with Timer1 Input Capture, including 16-bit overflow
   extension for low speeds.
2. Count pulses on an external interrupt over a fixed window and convert to RPM.
3. Share one SPI bus between two devices with independent chip selects, without
   corrupting either.
4. Drive an 8-lamp cluster through a 74HC595 shift register.
5. Implement a bulb-check sequence and a lamp priority scheme.
6. Read 32-bit counters shared with an ISR atomically, and prove the tearing bug exists without it.
7. Model an ignition key as a state machine with a cranking phase and a
   limp-home fault path.

### Speed maths — derive this in your report

```
Wheel sensor      : 4 pulses per wheel revolution
Wheel circumference: 2.000 m
Distance per pulse : 500 mm

Timer1 prescaler 64 @ 8 MHz  →  125 kHz  →  1 tick = 8 µs

period_us  = capture_delta_ticks × 8
speed_kmh  = 1 800 000 / period_us          (see derivation below)

  500 mm / period_us  =  (500e-3 m) / (period_us × 1e-6 s)
                      =  500 000 / period_us  m/s
                      =  1 800 000 / period_us  km/h     (× 3.6)
```

| Speed | `period_us` | Timer1 ticks | Fits 16-bit? |
|------:|------------:|-------------:|:------------:|
| 200 km/h | 9 000 | 1 125 | ✔ |
| 60 km/h | 30 000 | 3 750 | ✔ |
| 10 km/h | 180 000 | 22 500 | ✔ |
| 3.5 km/h | 514 000 | 64 300 | ✔ (just) |
| 2 km/h | 900 000 | 112 500 | ✘ — **needs overflow extension** |

Below ≈ 3.4 km/h a single 16-bit capture wraps. You **must** extend the capture
to 32 bits with a `TIMER1_OVF_vect` counter, and handle the classic race: if
`TOV1` is pending *and* the captured value is small, the overflow happened
before the capture.

### RPM maths

```
4-cylinder 4-stroke → 2 ignition pulses per crankshaft revolution
count pulses over a 250 ms window
RPM = count × (1000/250) × 60 / 2 = count × 120
```

At 6000 RPM the window collects 50 pulses — comfortably inside a `uint8_t`, but
use `uint16_t` anyway and say why.

### 9.2 The shared SPI bus — the tricky part

`lamps595.c` and `shiftreg.c` both use `MCAL/spi.c`. The bus is not free-for-all:

```c
/* Every SPI transaction is bracketed. No exceptions. */
void SPI_Acquire(SpiSlave_t s);   /* deassert all CS, apply this slave's mode,
                                     then assert its CS                      */
void SPI_Release(void);           /* deassert CS, leave the bus idle          */
```

Rules that earn (or lose) the SPI marks:

1. **Never** assert a second CS while another is low.
2. The 74HC595 has no `MISO`; do not read `SPDR` expecting data from it.
3. The 595 latch (`PC2`) is pulsed **after** `SPI_Release()`, never between
   bytes.
4. A lamp refresh is a multi-step sequence spread over several ticks — the
   lamp task must not steal the bus in the middle of it. Use a simple
   `busOwner` guard and make the lamp update wait a tick.
5. Both devices use Mode 0 here, so no mode switch is needed — say so
   explicitly in your report rather than leaving it implicit.

### 9.3 Warning-lamp priority

More than one warning can be active at once, but the LCD banner shows only one.
`warnings.c` resolves it:

```c
/* Lowest number wins. Returns WARN_NONE if nothing is active. */
Warn_t WRN_Highest(const CarData_t *d);
```

| Priority | Warning | Condition | Class |
|:--------:|---------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | `WARN_OIL` | Oil pressure < 1.0 bar with engine running | **Critical** → limp home |
| 2 | `WARN_BATT` | Battery < 12.0 V with engine running, or > 15.0 V | Critical |
| 3 | `WARN_COOLANT` | Coolant > 110 °C | **Critical** → limp home |
| 4 | `WARN_CHECK` | Any sensor implausible | Warning |
| 5 | `WARN_FUEL` | Fuel < 10 % | Warning |
| 6 | `WARN_OVERSPEED` | Speed > limit | Warning |
| 7 | `WARN_SEATBELT` | Seatbelt unbuckled ∧ speed > 10 km/h | Info |
| 8 | `WARN_DOOR` | Door open ∧ speed > 5 km/h | Info |
| 9 | `WARN_HANDBRAKE` | Handbrake on ∧ speed > 5 km/h | Info |

### 9.4 Module responsibilities

| Module | Owns | Public API (suggested) |
|--------|------|------------------------|
| `cluster_fsm` | Ignition state, cranking, limp home | `FSM_Init`, `FSM_Run`, `FSM_GetState` |
| `warnings` | Priority resolution, latching | `WRN_Update`, `WRN_Highest`, `WRN_Mask` |
| `speedo` | Capture delta → km/h, stall timeout | `SPD_OnCapture`, `SPD_OnOverflow`, `SPD_GetKmh` |
| `tacho` | INT0 count → RPM | `TAC_OnPulse`, `TAC_Update250ms`, `TAC_GetRpm` |
| `odometer` | Distance integration + atomic access | `ODO_AddDistance`, `ODO_GetTotal`, `ODO_GetTrip`, `ODO_ResetTrip` |
| `gauges` | ADC scaling + plausibility | `GAU_Update`, `GAU_Fuel`, `GAU_CoolantC`, `GAU_BattmV`, `GAU_OilBarX10` |
| `lamps595` | Cluster byte + blink phases + bulb check | `LMP_Set`, `LMP_Refresh`, `LMP_BulbCheck` |
| `display` | Page cycling, formatting | `DSP_Next`, `DSP_Render` |
| `chime` | Tone patterns | `CHM_Play(pattern)` |

### 9.5 Concurrency contract

- `ISR(TIMER1_CAPT_vect)` reads `ICR1`, combines it with the overflow count,
  stores a 32-bit delta into a `volatile` slot, sets a flag. **No division in
  the ISR** — the km/h conversion happens in the 100 ms task.
- `ISR(TIMER1_OVF_vect)` increments a `volatile uint16_t` and nothing else.
- `ISR(INT0_vect)` increments a `volatile uint16_t` pulse counter and nothing
  else.
- 32-bit shared values (`odoMetres`, capture delta) are read under
  `ATOMIC_BLOCK`.

## 11. System Specifications

### 11.1 Speed

| Band | Range | Behaviour |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Stationary | 0 km/h | No edge for 1 s |
| Low | 1 – 30 km/h | Requires 32-bit capture extension |
| Normal | 31 – 120 km/h | |
| Over limit | > `speedLimitKmh` (120) | `WARN_OVERSPEED`, chime every 5 s |
| Implausible | > 250 km/h | Rejected as noise, `WARN_CHECK` |

### 11.2 Engine RPM

| Band | Range | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| Stopped | 0 | Engine not running |
| Cranking | 100 – 400 | Starter engaged |
| Idle | 600 – 1000 | Running |
| Normal | 1001 – 5500 | |
| Red line | > 5500 | Chime + `WARN_CHECK` |

Engine is declared **running** when RPM > 500 for 500 ms, and **stalled** when
RPM < 300 for 1 s while in `CS_RUNNING`.

### 11.3 Analog channel scaling

| Channel | ADC range | Engineering range | Formula |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| Fuel | 0 – 1023 | 0 – 100 % | `raw*100/1023` |
| Coolant | 0 – 1023 | −40 – 130 °C | `(raw*170/1023) - 40` |
| Battery | 0 – 1023 | 0 – 16000 mV | `raw*16000/1023` |
| Oil pressure | 0 – 1023 | 0 – 100 (0.0 – 10.0 bar) | `raw*100/1023` |

All intermediates must be `uint32_t` — `raw*16000` reaches 16 368 000.

### 11.4 Warning thresholds

| Warning | Trip | Clear | Latching |
|---------|------|-------|:--------:|
| Low fuel | < 10 % | > 13 % | No |
| Oil pressure | < 1.0 bar, engine running, 2 s | > 1.5 bar | **Yes** |
| Battery low | < 12.0 V, engine running, 5 s | > 12.5 V | No |
| Battery high | > 15.0 V, 5 s | < 14.5 V | No |
| Coolant | > 110 °C, 3 s | < 105 °C | **Yes** |
| Over-speed | > limit | < limit − 5 | No |
| Seatbelt | unbuckled ∧ > 10 km/h | buckled ∨ < 10 km/h | No |
| Door | open ∧ > 5 km/h | closed | No |
| Handbrake | engaged ∧ > 5 km/h | released | No |

Latching warnings clear only at the next key-off/key-on cycle.

### 11.5 Fuel-tank model

Tank capacity 50 L. `fuelPct` maps linearly. Range remaining is computed from
the trip average consumption; if no consumption data exists yet, display `--`.

## 13. Functional Requirements

### FR-01 — Road-speed measurement by input capture

The system **shall** measure the wheel-sensor period with Timer1 Input Capture
and publish road speed in km/h at **10 Hz**.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Rising-edge capture with the input noise canceller (`ICNC1`) enabled.
- The captured period is extended to 32 bits with a Timer1 overflow counter, so
  speeds down to **1 km/h** are measured.
- Accuracy ±1 km/h between 5 and 200 km/h against the injected frequency.
- The ISR performs **no division**; conversion happens in the 100 ms task.
- Resolution at 100 km/h is better than 1 km/h — show the arithmetic.

### FR-02 — Zero-speed detection

If no capture edge arrives for **1 s**, the system **shall** publish `speed = 0`.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Stopping the pulse source makes the display read 0 within 1.1 s.
- No stale speed is ever displayed after the pulses stop.
- Restarting the pulses produces a valid speed within two edges (the first
  post-stall delta is discarded).

### FR-03 — Engine RPM measurement

The system **shall** count `INT0` pulses over a **250 ms** window and publish RPM
at 4 Hz.

**Acceptance criteria**
- `RPM = count × 120` for the default 2 pulses/revolution.
- Accuracy ±60 RPM from 600 to 6000 RPM.
- The counter is read and zeroed atomically at the window boundary — no pulse is
  double-counted or lost.

### FR-04 — Analog gauge acquisition

The system **shall** sample all four analog channels with the rates and scaling
of §11.3.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Fuel and coolant are damped with an 8-sample moving average — fuel slosh must
  not make the gauge jump.
- Battery and oil are lightly filtered (median-of-3) so a genuine drop is caught
  quickly.
- All intermediates are `uint32_t`; verified by inspecting the scaling code.

### FR-05 — Odometer integration

The system **shall** accumulate distance in **metres** from wheel pulses.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Each captured edge adds `MM_PER_PULSE` to a millimetre accumulator; whole
  metres are carried into `odoMetres` and `tripMetres`.
- Integration is exact — no drift from repeated km/h × time multiplication.
- 1000 pulses at 500 mm each register exactly 500 m.
- `odoMetres` is `uint32_t` and saturates rather than wrapping.

### FR-06 — Odometer integrity

The system **shall** maintain the odometer as a 32-bit metre count that is never
read in a torn state and never decreases.

**Acceptance criteria**
- A write occurs every `ODO_SAVE_METRES` (100 m) travelled **or** every
  `ODO_SAVE_SEC` (60 s), whichever comes first, and immediately on key-off.
- Writes use the 8-slot wear-levelling scheme of §19.2; the slot with the highest
  valid sequence number wins at boot.
- Yanking power mid-drive and rebooting shows a value within 100 m of the truth.
- A write interrupted halfway must **not** produce a corrupt odometer — the
  previous slot remains valid. Demonstrate this in TC-19.

### FR-07 — Trip meter

The system **shall** maintain a resettable trip meter with trip distance,
average speed and elapsed time.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Holding the trip-reset button for **2 s** zeroes trip distance, trip time and
  average; the lifetime odometer is untouched.
- Average speed = trip metres × 3.6 / trip seconds, integer maths.
- A short press cycles the display page instead of resetting — the hold is what
  resets.

### FR-08 — Warning-lamp cluster over 74HC595

The system **shall** drive all eight cluster lamps by shifting one byte out over
SPI and pulsing `PC2`.

**Acceptance criteria**
- The lamp byte is refreshed every **50 ms**.
- The 595 is written **only** through `SPI_Acquire(SPI_SLAVE_LAMPS)` /
  `SPI_Release()`.
- The latch pulse occurs after the byte is fully shifted, and is ≥ 1 µs wide.
- No lamp flicker at the 50 ms refresh rate.

### FR-09 — Bulb check

On entering `CS_IGNITION` the system **shall** illuminate **all eight** lamps for
**3 s**, then extinguish those with no active condition.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Exactly 3 s ±100 ms, timed by the scheduler.
- The LCD shows `BULB CHECK` during the sequence.
- After the check, the lamp byte reflects only genuinely active warnings.

### FR-10 — Warning priority and banner

The system **shall** resolve simultaneously active warnings by the priority table
of §9.3 and show only the highest on the LCD banner.

**Acceptance criteria**
- With oil and fuel warnings both active, the banner shows the oil warning; both
  lamps are lit.
- `warnMask` in the telemetry frame reports every active warning simultaneously.
- Critical warnings (priority 1 – 3) latch until the next key cycle.

### FR-11 — Turn indicators

Turn-signal switches **shall** blink their lamps at **450 ms on / 450 ms off**
with a synchronised buzzer tick.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Both switches on simultaneously → hazard behaviour: both lamps blink in phase.
- Blink phase is generated by the scheduler, not by a delay loop.
- Releasing the switch extinguishes the lamp within one blink period.

### FR-12 — Ignition state machine

The system **shall** implement the ignition sequence
`OFF → ACC → IGNITION → BULBCHECK → CRANKING → RUNNING`.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Each ignition-key press advances `OFF → ACC → IGNITION`; a long press (2 s)
  returns to `OFF`.
- The Start button is honoured only in `CS_IGNITION` after the bulb check.
- Cranking is limited to `CRANK_MAX_TICKS` (5 s); on expiry it returns to
  `CS_IGNITION` and logs `!EVT,CRANK,FAIL`.
- `CS_RUNNING` is entered when RPM > 500 for 500 ms.
- In `CS_OFF` the cluster is dark, the LCD shows only the odometer for 10 s,
  then blanks.

### FR-13 — Stall detection

If RPM falls below 300 for **1 s** while in `CS_RUNNING`, the system **shall**
enter `CS_STALLED`.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Lamp cluster shows oil + battery lamps (as a real car does with the engine
  off but the key on).
- `!EVT,ENGINE,STALL` is logged.
- Pressing Start re-enters `CS_CRANKING`.

### FR-14 — Limp-home mode

A **critical** warning (oil pressure or coolant) **shall** put the cluster into
`CS_LIMP_HOME`.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Continuous chime for 5 s, then one chirp every 10 s.
- LCD banner alternates `!! STOP ENGINE !!` with the cause every 1 s.
- The state is latched for the rest of the key cycle even if the sensor recovers.
- `!EVT,LIMP,OIL` (or `COOLANT`) is logged with the sensor snapshot.

### FR-15 — Over-speed warning

Exceeding `speedLimitKmh` **shall** raise `WARN_OVERSPEED`.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Chime once, then repeat every 5 s while over the limit.
- Clears when speed falls 5 km/h below the limit (hysteresis).
- The limit is settable 30 – 200 km/h over the console.

### FR-16 — Maximum-speed record

The system **shall** record the highest speed of the current key cycle and the
all-time maximum.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Session max resets at key-on; the since-boot max is held separately.
- A new all-time record triggers `!EVT,MAXSPEED,<kmh>`.
- Implausible readings (> 250 km/h) never enter the record.

### FR-17 — Display pages

The Display-cycle button **shall** rotate through five LCD pages:

```
PG_MAIN        SPD:  62 km/h    | RPM:2450 F:78%
PG_TRIP        TRIP: 42.7 km    | AVG:58 T:00:44
PG_ENGINE      RPM:2450 C: 92C  | OIL:3.4bar
PG_ELECTRICAL  BATT:14.2V       | ODO:123456 km
PG_DIAG        WARN:0x0021      | ST:RUN UP:2650
```

**Acceptance criteria**
- Refresh 250 ms, changed characters only, no flicker.
- The page selection is remembered across key cycles (held in the running config).
- In `CS_LIMP_HOME` the banner overrides the page every other second.

### FR-18 — Sensor plausibility

Any analog channel pinned at 0 or 1023 for **5 s** **shall** raise `WARN_CHECK`
and name the channel in the diagnostics stream.

**Acceptance criteria**
- The affected gauge shows `---` rather than a false value.
- The check-engine lamp lights.
- The warning clears 2 s after the reading returns to range.

### FR-19 — Diagnostics telemetry and console

The system **shall** transmit the frame of §18.1 every **5 s** and accept the
commands of §18.2, with the book's parser robustness rules.

**Acceptance criteria**
- The odometer **cannot** be increased from the console — `SET ODO` is rejected
  with `ERR PROTECTED`. Say why in your report.
- `SET ODO` **may** be allowed once, guarded by `UNLOCK <code>`, as a bonus.

## 14. Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **NFR-01** | Compiles with `avr-gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -Os`, zero warnings. |
| **NFR-02** | No blocking delay > 10 ms in the super-loop; `_delay_ms` only in `*_Init()`. |
| **NFR-03** | No division, modulo or `float` inside any ISR. |
| **NFR-04** | Capture and overflow ISRs together ≤ 30 µs, so no edge is missed at 500 Hz. |
| **NFR-05** | Two SPI slaves are never selected simultaneously; every transaction is bracketed by `SPI_Acquire`/`SPI_Release`. |
| **NFR-06** | A 74HC165 read is never interrupted by a 74HC595 refresh, or the reverse. |
| **NFR-07** | No floating-point arithmetic anywhere. |
| **NFR-08** | All calibration constants (`pulsesPerRev`, `wheelCircMm`, …) come from `DashCfg_t`, never hard-coded in the speed maths. |
| **NFR-09** | Layer rule respected; only `MCAL/*.c` touches registers. |
| **NFR-10** | 32-bit shared values are read atomically. |
| **NFR-11** | Tick jitter ≤ ±1 ms; CPU load ≤ 60 % at 200 km/h (worst-case capture rate), measured on `PC6`. |
| **NFR-12** | `.data + .bss` ≤ 1 KB. |
| **NFR-13** | The odometer never decreases, never wraps, and is never lost by more than 100 m. |
| **NFR-14** | Every 32-bit counter shared with an ISR is read atomically. |
| **NFR-15** | The cluster reaches a defined state within 200 ms of any reset. |
| **NFR-16** | **No dynamic memory.** `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`, `alloca` and variable-length arrays are banned. Every buffer, table, queue and log is a fixed-size array whose length is a `#define` in `config.h`. Prove it: `avr-nm main.elf \| grep -i malloc` must print nothing. |
| **NFR-17** | **No recursion.** No function may call itself, directly or through any chain of calls — the call graph must be acyclic. Every search, scan, parse and traversal is written as a loop. State your worst-case stack depth in the report. |

## 19. Task Scheduling

| ID | Task | Period | Offset | Budget | Work |
|----|------|:------:|:------:|:------:|------|
| T-1 | `Task_Inputs` | 10 ms | 0 | 200 µs | Buttons, body switches, debounce |
| T-2 | `Task_FSM` | 10 ms | 0 | 200 µs | Cluster `switch` |
| T-3 | `Task_Lamps` | 50 ms | 1 | 400 µs | Warning eval + 595 shift + latch |
| T-4 | `Task_Speed` | 100 ms | 2 | 600 µs | Capture delta → km/h, odometer carry |
| T-5 | `Task_Tacho` | 250 ms | 3 | 150 µs | Close RPM window |
| T-6 | `Task_LCD` | 250 ms | 5 | 4 ms | Page repaint |
| T-7 | `Task_Gauges` | 500 ms | 4 | 1 ms | 4 ADC channels + filters |
| T-8 | `Task_1Hz` | 1 s | 6 | 400 µs | Trip timers, chime schedule |
| T-9 | `Task_Report` | 5 s | 8 | 2 ms | Diagnostics frame |
| T-10 | `Task_Console` | 20 ms | 7 | 500 µs | Parse one line |

**Bus conflict:** T-3 and T-11 both want SPI. T-11 owns the bus for the duration
of a multi-step write; T-3 skips one cycle when the bus is busy. Show that a
skipped lamp refresh is invisible (50 ms → 100 ms is still flicker-free).
